# UI Iteration Process

## Trigger
Use this skill for updates to an existing UI instead of building from zero.

## Workflow
1. Audit current screen for hierarchy, spacing, CTA clarity, and state consistency.
2. Prioritize issues by impact (high clarity/low effort first).
3. Apply minimal edits that reuse existing primitives.
4. Run regression checks for layout, interaction states, and route behavior.
5. Summarize what changed and what improved.

## Output Contract
Return:
1. Change summary by priority.
2. Before/after behavior notes.
3. Touched files with patch-ready edits.
4. Verification commands and expected result.
