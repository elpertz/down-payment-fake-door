# UX Exploration Flow

## Trigger
Use this skill when the user wants options, alternatives, or experiment-led UX decisions.

## Workflow
1. Define the user goal and task to optimize.
2. Propose 2-3 variants with clear differences.
3. Map tradeoffs for each variant (clarity, complexity, speed to implement).
4. Recommend one direction with explicit rationale.
5. Define a testable hypothesis and what to measure.
6. Implement or prepare patch-ready edits for the chosen variant.

## Output Contract
Return:
1. Variant A/B/C summary.
2. Chosen variant and reason.
3. Next experiment step.
4. Patch-ready edits and verification steps.
