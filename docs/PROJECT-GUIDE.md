# Project Guide

## How To Use

1. Open `/prototypes/example-one` and create your first flow.
2. Open `/examples` and copy component patterns.
3. Reuse existing components from `/components/ui`.
4. Validate your changes with:
   - `pnpm lint`
   - `pnpm build`

## Best Practices

1. Keep one prototype flow per section or page.
2. Keep labels and helper text clear and short.
3. Use semantic states for success/warning/error feedback.
4. Verify desktop and mobile before sharing.
5. Keep motion minimal and purposeful.

## Prompt Suggestions

- `Start a prototype in /app/prototypes/page.tsx for a signup flow.`
- `Create a new section using existing components from /app/examples/page.tsx.`
